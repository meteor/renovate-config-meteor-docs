# Meteor Docs Renovate Configuration

This is a blanket [Renovate](https://renovateapp.com/) configuration for all
Meteor-related docs repositories.  It inherits part of its configuration from
the upstream [MDG-wide Renovate docs
configuration](https://npm.im/renovate-config-mdg-docs), which should be
considered first when making changes to this repository.
